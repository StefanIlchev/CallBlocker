# Call Blocker: Privacy Policy

I hereby state that to the best of my knowledge and belief, I have not programmed this app to collect any personally
identifiable information. All data created by the user is stored locally on their device, and can be erased by clearing
the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.
